This code is lightly obsolete due to Poloniex changed its api. But still some ideas can be used for finding peaks of some functions.

Python 3; Uses: math, numpy, requests, json, time, datetime

sell(pair, x0,y0, buyprice, currentprice, mimNumberOfTradesBefore, accur, testmod, startTime, currentTime)

Returns true if there is a peak-like part of graph to sell currecy in this point of pump.
pair –currency pair
x0 – array of times of deals
y0 – array of prices of deals
buyprice – ...
currentprice – ...
mimNumberOfTradesBefore – deals to skip to accumulate enough data to analyze
accur – defines sensitivity for peaks – 12 by defaul
testmod – False by default, if True - returns an array of all deals in period between starttime and currenttime in format  dd-mm-yy hh:mm:ss


stoplimit(buypr ,currentpr, lastResult, exr_intervals)

Returns True if bot has to sell currency. 
Works in case:
- Peak of expected size is found (bigger than exr_intervals's last element)
- Current price is lower than initial buy price.
- Graph crossed one of stop-limit points and peak was found before.

buypr – buyprice
currentpr – currentprice
lastResult – last peak's price (sell function returned True)
exr_intervals – stop-limit points [-0.015,0.03,0.7,0.11]
